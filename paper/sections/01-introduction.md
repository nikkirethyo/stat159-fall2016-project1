1. Motivation 
In data science there is an abundance of tools at your disposal, which can be overwhelming for beginners. This paper is designed as a tutorial, created both by and for, some of these tools. It's purpose is to familiarize the reader with basic but essential tools to develop a reproducible and collaborative workflow.

2. Scope 
The scope of this paper will be how to use and work with Gnu Make, Git, GitHub, Pandoc, Markdown, and Vim. It's emphasis will be on what these tools are for, how to get started with them, and their use in a successful workflow. These tools will mostly help you to collaborate with others and more so to create reproducible reports and analysis. We will not spend covering more traditional topics such as statistics, data visualization, etc. Before beginning to do proper analysis of data first one needs to learn tools to help us re-run analysis with new data, understand file dependencies, and more. All of which will be covered in the following. 

3. Goal 
At the end of this paper, the reader should be able to reproduce it completely on their own.
