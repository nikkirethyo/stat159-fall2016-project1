1. Motivation 
In data science there is an abundance of tools at your disposal, which can be overwhelming for beginners. This paper is designed as a tutorial, created both by and for, some of these tools. It's purpose is to familiarize the reader with basic but essential tools to develop a reproducible and collaborative workflow.

2. Scope

It's emphasis will be around tools to help you collaborate with others and more so create reproducible reports and analysis, rather than around statistics, data visualization, etc. Before beginning to do proper analysis of data first one needs to learn tools to help us re-run analysis with new data, understand file dependencies, and more. All of which will be covered in the following.
